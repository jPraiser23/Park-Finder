## Introduction

Looking for something to do outdoors? Not sure if your local green space is pet friendly? Park Finder can help

- Find all public parks within a chosen local area
- Determine outdoor activities at specific green space locations
- Congregate information about outdoor locations
- Display images of public parks before you actually go

Use your mobile device as a hub for all the information you could need before you make your trip to the park with your kids or pets for the day.
